# Helicopter

This is a simple game where you control a helicopter and try to avoid obstacles to stay in the air as long as possible. It was created using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

Getting Started

To play the game, simply visit https://sonnymay.github.io/Helicopter/ in your web browser. There's no need to install anything or set up any additional software.

How to Play

Use the up arrow key to make the helicopter fly higher, and the down arrow key to make it fly lower. Try to avoid the obstacles in your path, as hitting them will cause you to crash and the game to end. The longer you stay in the air, the higher your score will be.
